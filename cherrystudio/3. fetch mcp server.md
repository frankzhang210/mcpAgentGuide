**Overview**

Fetch is an open-source web crawler MCP server designed to retrieve and process web content from specified URLs. It enables CherryStudio to extract information from websites, process the data, and make it available for various applications. Fetch is particularly useful for gathering data for training models, content analysis, and information extraction tasks.

* Processing and cleaning HTML content
* Extracting relevant information from web pages
* Providing structured data for downstream applications
* Supporting data collection for model training and analysis

**Configuration**

Add the following configuration to your CherryStudio MCP servers configuration:
In CherryStudio, Settings --> MCP Settings --> Edit, paste below within the mcpServer segment.

```
"fetch": {
      "isActive": true,
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch"
      ],
      "name": "fetch"
    }

* `name`: Identifier for the server instance

**Usage Example**

1. Click on the **[Assistant]** icon in CherryStudio
2. In the chat dialog, ask questions as follows,

<pre class="code-block"><div class="enhanced-code-block"><code class="hljs"><span>can you crawl and summarize this page: https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5471281/aca-health-insurance-premiums-obamacare-bbb-kff
</span></code></div></pre>
